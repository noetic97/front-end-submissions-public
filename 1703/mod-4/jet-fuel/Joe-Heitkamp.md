# Basics

#### Link to the Github Repository for the Project
[jetfuel](https://github.com/noetic97/jet-fuel)

#### Link to the Deployed Application

#### Link to your annotated server file
[annotated server file](https://github.com/noetic97/jet-fuel/blob/server-descriptions/server.js)

## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Mostly.  You can not filter the links by date and the date is not showing next to the links.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

* All of the client-side interactions are tested

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/noetic97/jet-fuel/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js)
Line 250-258
``` response.body.map((link) => {
          link.should.have.property('id')
          link.should.have.property('description')
          link.should.have.property('ogURL')
          link.should.have.property('shortURL')
          link.should.have.property('folder_id')
          link.should.have.property('created_at')
          link.should.have.property('updated_at')
        })```

* It was a simple solution to testing multiple links without having to test each link by hand.  I wasn't sure if it was possible to map and then test over each result, but it worked right away!

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/noetic97/jet-fuel/tree/master/db/migrations)

* I do not like having these accidental migrations that now throw warnings in my test results.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
